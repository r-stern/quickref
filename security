Chosen ciphertext attack: attacker has pairs of ciphertexts and plaintexts, however, these pairs are for ciphertexts chosen by the attacker

Chosen plaintext attack: attacker has pairs of ciphertexts and plaintexts, however, these pairs are for plaintexts chosen by the attacker

CIA triad:
  confidentiality, integrity, availability
  
Ciphertext only attack: attacker has a collection of ciphertexts

Computational Security: scheme is secure even if a tiny amount of information is leaked about the plaintext to adversaries with bounded computational power. Ensures that security is guaranteed against efficient adversaries

Known plaintext attack: attacker has a collectino of ciphertext and plaintext pairs
  
One time pad: a perfectly secure algorithm for encryption if done correctly. Bitwise xor of key and ciphertext, however, keys need to be as long as plaintext and can NEVER be reused.
  
Perfectly Secrecy: the notion that nothing about a plaintext can be learned from the ciphertext, including length, etc.

Pseudorandomness: need a nefficient porces to expand a short random string into a long string that appears random, not truly random because it is derived deterministically, and the output is dependent on initial values

Pseudorandom generators: G is one if EXPANSION: for a polynomial l, it holds that for all n, l(n)>n, and models extracting randomness from short random string; PSEUDORANDOMNESS: no efficient statistical test can tell output apart from a truly random string

Public/Asymmetric Key Encryption:

Shift Ciphers: not perfectly secure because one can do frequency analysis on the ciphertext and deduce things about the plaintext, form example: the length, and that since the most common letter of the english language is E, the most common appearing letter in the ciphertext will likely correspond to e, and with that clue an attacker and deduce more about the plaintext

Private/Symmetric key encryption:
